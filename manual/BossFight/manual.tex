\section*{Overview}

Boss Fight is an emulation and re-envisioning of the Yamaha YM2612 audio processing unit from the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Genesis. Boss Fight provides the key functionality of the 3rd channel of Yamaha YM2612, in addition to some hacks, omissions, and re-envisioned features, namely,
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{16-bit Audio:} It's 8 bits better than the previous generation of chips! This is marketing! We're actually lying though -- the YM2612 produced a \textit{14-bit} PCM stream, and so does BossFight. You're not getting those 2 bits back; go cry about it.
  \item \textbf{4-Operator FM Synthesis:} Full panel and CV control over the parameters for each of the four operators including envelopes, multipliers, rate scalings, tunings, gates, and LFO modulations.
  \item \textbf{8 FM Algorithms:} 8 different arrangements of the four operators following the original chip implementation.
  \item \textbf{Operator 1 Feedback:} Feedback into operator one for interesting timbres or total wave destruction.
  \item \textbf{Individual Operator Frequencies:} Control the frequency of each operator to produce weird, harsh, and trashed noises.
  \item \textbf{Looping Envelopes:} Transform the one-shot envelope generators of individual operators into looping AD envelopes.
  \item \textbf{Aliasing Control:} The YM2612 hard clips the output signal when it gets too loud. This is both a musically useful effect for introducing high-order harmonics, as well as aliasing. Nyquist lied to you, aliasing is your friend. However, if you are not a fan of clipping and aliasing, aliasing control allows you to attenuate the output signal from the chip \textit{before} it passes through the hard clipper to prevent fully saturating the 14-bit PCM stream.
  \item \textbf{VU Meter:} A VU meter tracks how hot the signal from BossFight is getting and makes it easy to visualize how much clipping is occurring.
  \item \textbf{Low-Frequency Oscillator:} A shared low-frequency sine oscillator controls amplitude modulation and frequency modulation of each operator.
  \item \textbf{Mono Output:} The original YM2612 was stereo, but only because it had six channels of synthesis. Boss Fight is a monophonic voice so there is no built-in stereo processing.
  \item \textbf{Semi-Modular Normalization:} Inputs are normalled forward across the operators to reduce the amount of patch cables for setting up simple patches quickly.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Stereo master output from the module.
  \item $V$/Octave inputs for each of the 6 synthesizer voices. The inputs are normalled from top to bottom.
  \item Gate inputs for each of the 6 synthesizer voices.  The inputs are normalled from top to bottom. The gate goes high at $2V$ and triggers the envelope generator on the operators. Figure~\ref{fig:envelope-generator} illustrates how the envelope generator interprets \texttt{key on} and \texttt{key off} events in the gate signal.
  \item Algorithm selector and display. The YM2612 offers eight distinct FM synthesis algorithm based on the four operators on the module. Figure~\ref{fig:fm-algorithms} describes the configuration of the operators in each of the algorithms. Table~\ref{tab:fm-algorithm-instruments} presents some possible uses for each of the algorithms.
  \item Feedback control for operator 1. The value of this parameters determines how much the output of operator 1 feeds back into itself.
  \item Frequency control for the LFO. The LFO modulates the amplitude and phase of the operators. The sensitivity to amplitude modulation can be controlled by \textit{7}. The sensitivity to frequency modulation can be controlled by \textit{8}. Amplitude modulation can be enabled / disabled using \textit{10(d)}.
  \item Amplitude modulation control. Controls the sensitivity to amplitude modulation for all 6 voices.
  \item Frequency modulation control. Controls the sensitivity to frequency modulation for all 6 voices.

  \item Control over the envelope generator parameters for each of the four operators on the module. Figure~\ref{fig:envelope-generator} depicts the stages in the envelope generator. \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Total Level (\texttt{TL}):} The highest amplitude of the envelope generator. A change of one unit is about $0.75dB$.
    \item \textbf{Attack Rate (\texttt{AR}):} The angle of initial amplitude increase. This can be made very steep if desired. The problem with slow attack rates is that if the notes are short, the release (called \texttt{key off}) occurs before the note has reached a reasonable level.
    \item \textbf{Decay Rate (\texttt{D1R}):} The angle of initial amplitude decrease from the highest point in the envelope generator.
    \item \textbf{Total Level 1 (\texttt{T1L}):} The amplitude where the second decay stage starts.
    \item \textbf{Sustain Rate (\texttt{D2R}):} The angle of secondary amplitude decrease. This will continue indefinitely unless \texttt{key off} occurs.
    \item \textbf{Release Rate (\texttt{RR}):} The final angle of amplitude decrease, after \texttt{key off}.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Control over the FM parameters for each of the four operators on the module. \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Multiplier (\texttt{MUL}):} An integer multiplier for the frequency of the operator. MUL ranges from $0$ to $15$, and multiplies the overall frequency, with the exception that $0$ results in multiplication by $\frac{1}{2}$.
    \item \textbf{Detune (\texttt{DT1}):} Integer variation from the multiplied frequency. \texttt{DT1} can be thought of as a linear frequency modulation parameter.
    \item \textbf{Rate Scaling (\texttt{RS}):} the degree to which envelopes become shorter as frequencies become higher. For example, high notes on a piano fade much more quickly than low notes.
    \item \textbf{Amplitude Modulation (\texttt{AM}):} Whether amplitude modulation is enabled for the given operator. The amplitude modulation is controlled by the global LFO.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
