\section*{Overview}

Mega Tone is an emulation of the Texas Instruments SN76489 audio processing unit from the Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive, and Sega Genesis. The SN76489 chip contains three pulse waveform generators and an LFSR-based noise generator that selects between pitched white-noise and static periodic noise. Mega Tone provides the key features of the SN76489 chip, namely,
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Triple Pulse Waveform Generator:} Three 8-bit pulse waves with $50\%$ duty cycle and 10-bit frequency parameter
  \item \textbf{Noise Generator:} Generate either pitched white-noise based on the frequency of oscillator three, or static periodic noise at one of three shift frequencies: $\frac{N}{2048}$, $\frac{N}{1024}$, $\frac{N}{512}$ where $N$ is the reference clock rate (which is something like $3579545Hz$).
  \item \textbf{4-bit Amplifier:} A 4-bit amplifier controls the output level of each oscillator with mixer sliders and CV inputs
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{1{\quad}Pitch}

The trimpot controls the coarse frequency of the three oscillators. Frequency
is quantized to a 10-bit value for the tone generators, which is particularly
noticeable in the very low/high registers. The ports provide and exponential
($V$/Octave) inputs for controlling the pitch of the pulse waveform
generators.

\subsection*{2{\quad}Noise Frequency}

The noise generator can be set to one of four settings. The first setting
produces pitched white noise based on the frequency of tone generator 3. The
remaining three settings produce a static pitched white noised at rates of
$\frac{N}{2048}$, $\frac{N}{1024}$, $\frac{N}{512}$ where $N$ is the reference
clock rate, which is something like $3579545Hz$ on the Sega consoles. The input
port provides voltage control over the noise frequency setting where each
discrete setting is allocated $2.5$ Volts of input range.

\subsection*{3{\quad}Frequency Modulation}

When nothing is patched to the frequency modulation port, the trimpot can be
used to fine tune the frequency of the given tone generator. When a signal is
patched, the input port provides linear frequency modulation to the
corresponding tone generator, and the trimpot can be used as an attenuverter
to attenuate / polarize the incoming signal.

\subsection*{4{\quad}LFSR}

When the switch is pointing up, the noise generator produces periodic noise.
When pointing down, pitched white noise is generated. The input port acts like
a gate that goes high at $2V$ and inverts the value of the LFSR switch.

\subsection*{5{\quad}Amplifier}

When no input is connected, the trimpot controls the level from $0\%$ to
$100\%$ with 4-bit resolution. When an input is patched to the port, the
trimpot acts like an attenuator that scales the CV control over the volume
level. Because the amplifier has 4-bit control, the envelope of the oscillator
will sound quantized when used with and external envelope generator.

\subsection*{6{\quad}Outputs}

Each voice produces an output signal of at most ${\approx}10V_{pp}$ when the
amplifier is maxed out. The oscillator cannot be overdriven to produce
clipping, distortion, or aliasing.
