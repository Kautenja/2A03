\section{Overview}

Step Saw is an emulation of the Konami VRC6 sound chip from the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The VRC6 chip contains two pulse wave generators, and a quantized saw wave generator. Step Saw provides the key features of the VRC6 chip, namely,
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Dual pulse wave generator:} Dual pulse waves with 12-bit frequency value and eight duty cycles: $6.25\%$, $12.5\%$, $18.75\%$, $25\%$, $31.25\%$, $37.5\%$, $43.75\%$, and $50\%$
  \item \textbf{Quantized saw wave generator:} Stepped/quantized saw waveform with retro wave-folding distortion effect
  \item \textbf{4-bit Amplifier:} A 4-bit amplifier controls the output level of each oscillator with base/attenuator knobs and CV inputs
  \item \textbf{Channel Mixer:} Mix the voices together internally with hard clipping and intentional aliasing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frequency}

The trimpot controls the coarse frequency of the three waveform generators. Frequency is quantized to a 12-bit value for the oscillators, which is particularly noticeable in the very low / high registers. The ports provide an exponential $V$/Octave input for controlling the pitch of the tone generators. Inputs are normalled forward from Tone 1, to Tone 2, to Saw.

\subsection{Frequency Modulation}

When nothing is patched to the frequency modulation port, the trimpot can be used to fine tune the frequency of the given waveform generator. When a signal is patched, the input port provides linear frequency modulation to the corresponding waveform generator and the trimpot can be used as an attenuverter to attenuate / polarize the incoming signal. Inputs are normalled forward from Tone 1, to Tone 2, to Saw, and support audio rates.

\subsection{Amplifier}

When no input is connected, the trimpot controls the given waveform generator volume level with 4-bit resolution (i.e., $\in [0, 15]$). When an input is patched to the port, the trimpot acts like an attenuator that scales the CV control over the volume level. Because the amplifier has 4-bit control, the envelope of the voice will sound quantized when used with an external envelope generator. Inputs are normalled forward from Tone 1, to Tone 2, to Saw. At a volume level of `40` ($\approx$ 1PM), the saw waveform general will begin to fold over onto itself and distort. This can be useful for fat bass-lines.

\subsection{Saw Waveform Hard Sync}

An input patched to this port will reset the phase of the saw waveform generator when the signal crosses a $2V$ threshold. This input supports audio rates.

\subsection{Pulse Width}

The trimpot chooses between eight duty cycles: $6.25\%$, $12.5\%$, $18.75\%$, $25\%$, $31.25\%$, $37.5\%$, $43.75\%$, and $50\%$. When an input is patched to the port, the CV controls the offset from the trimpot's position. The position of the knob is offset by the CV in increments of $1V$. Inputs are normalled forward from Tone 1 to Tone 2.

\subsection{Outputs}

Each voice produces an output signal of at most $10V_{pp}$ when the amplifier is maxed out. The individual oscillators cannot be overdriven to produce clipping, distortion, or aliasing \footnote{The saw waveform generator features a built-in wave-folder that does not introduce aliased frequencies when the amplifier is overdriven.}. However, outputs are normalled forward into a sum mix where hard clipping \textit{can} occur. Excess clipping will introduce an aliasing effect to the mix. Outputs in the mix are clipped \textit{before} being normalled to the next output. VU meter lights measure the output of individual channels going from off ($-\infty dB$ to $-12dB$), to green ($-12dB$ to $0dB$), and lastly to red ($0dB$ to $3dB$) when clipping begins to occur.
